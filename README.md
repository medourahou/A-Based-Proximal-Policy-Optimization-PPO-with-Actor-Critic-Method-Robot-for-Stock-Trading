# A-Based-Proximal-Policy-Optimization-PPO-with-Actor-Critic-Method-Robot-for-Stock-Trading

This project implements a stock trading robot using an A-Based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with the Actor-Critic method. The goal of the robot is to learn optimal trading strategies to maximize profits while trading stocks.

The project consists of three main components:

**1- Stock Data Environment (StockTradingEnv):**

This component provides the environment for the stock trading robot. It allows the robot to interact with historical stock data and make decisions based on the observed data. The environment includes features such as historical stock prices, indicators like RSI, MACD, ATR, and more. The environment offers discrete actions (Buy, Sell, Hold) in one code and continuous actions in another code.

**2- A-Based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO):**

The PPO algorithm is a powerful deep reinforcement learning method used for optimizing the policy of the stock trading robot. PPO aims to strike a balance between stability and sample efficiency, making it well-suited for continuous action spaces. It leverages the Actor-Critic architecture for policy improvement and value function estimation.

**3- Actor-Critic Method:**

The Actor-Critic method is employed in combination with PPO to enhance the training process of the stock trading robot. The Actor represents the policy network, which is responsible for selecting actions based on observations, while the Critic estimates the value function, providing feedback on the expected rewards.

The project aims to create an intelligent agent capable of learning from historical stock data and adjusting its trading decisions based on market dynamics. By using A-Based PPO with the Actor-Critic method, the robot can navigate the complexities of stock trading and adapt its strategies to changing market conditions.
